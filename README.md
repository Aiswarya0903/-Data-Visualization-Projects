The aim of the project involves the analysis of non-school district taxable property values on commercial corridors in the CRA of St. Petersburg, FL since 2018 with a focus on understanding annual changes and overall trends. The analysis depicts the insights into how these values of all corridors changed over the designated period of time, helping anyone intending on building, rent, purchasing, or investing in property located in St. Petersburg. The project's goal is to examine the efficiency of the city of St. Petersburg's investments (both public and private) in various corridors of interest and to learn which investments have been the most successful so that the city might make similar investments in the future.

This project gives insights into Sales Analytics globally where the performance of different products across various companies and countries were analyzed and visualized which can help in the decision-making process for estimation and production of different products at the manufacturing units.
